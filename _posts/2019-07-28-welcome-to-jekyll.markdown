I have recently shifted from `vim` to `neovim` in hopes finding some of the auto completions more manageable. I tried to have completion for vim 8.1 with using a LSP server protocol but it was behaving very much wonky. Some other motivation to try out neovim is to use `Vim-Plug` as well as `deoplete` completion manager.

Some of the Problems which I have faced till now with Neovim:
1. Base 16 Theme does not work with tmux
2. Need to still find a way to get the autocompletion for Java Working in neovim.
