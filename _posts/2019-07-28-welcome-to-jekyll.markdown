I have recently shifted from `vim` to `neovim` in hopes finding some of the auto completions more manageable. 
I tried to have completion for vim 8.1 with using a LSP server protocol but it was behaving very much wonky.
Some other motivation to try out neovim is to use `Vim-Plug` as well as `deoplete` completion manager.

## Noticeable Differences so far..
1. Linting errors on the same line with lesser shades.

2. `Neomake` makes life much easier than what I would see worp/Ale

3. I have had many problems with completion engines like `YCM` but with deoplete I did not
find any difference in performance.

4. I haven't made my dotfiles for nvim public but I would be doing that in the near future.
